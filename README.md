# Desktop_Viewport
Create a viewport (form) that can be schared with MS Teams

Install VCL (https://www.videolan.org/)
Start the application, position and size the form to your needs.
Hit the button, the form wil become transparent and a new (VCL) window will open.
The tranparent form can not be sized or moved any more!

The underlying part of the tranparent form wil be shown in the new VCL form/window and kan be shared with e.g. MS Teams.
Select 'Window sharing' in Teams and not 'Desktop sharing' and share the new VCL window.
If insisting on sharing the desktop maximize the VCL window and share the desktop covered with the VCL window.
When draging other forms/windows unerneath the 'viewport' only the part covered by the viewport is shared/visible for the attendees.

No licence what so ever!
Application and Delphi 5 source code included (yep I am old, old, old school!).
